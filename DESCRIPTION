Description: This is a package that provides a function which takes
        1) a reference genome;
        2) a set of interesting genomic regions;
        3) a list of short search sequences to be identified within the interesting genomic regions(exact matching);
        and returns an overall count for each search sequence within the interesting genomic regions.
